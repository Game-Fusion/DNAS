# DNAS
The DNAS server development repository

DNAS is Game Fusion's Dynamic Network Authentication System, which will hopefully use HTTP to connect to game servers globally.
The authentication might be implemented but if it is, it's a necessary evil, as people playing on standard PCs that conflict with GS2s could have modded versions of the games. Precautions aside, have a look at the plans for DNAS' future.
